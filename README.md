# react-list-key

In React, a list is a collection of items that are rendered together. Keys are unique identifiers that are assigned to each item in a list. React uses keys to identify which items in a list have changed, added, or removed. This helps React to efficiently update the UI when the data changes.
To render a list in React, you can use the map() function. The map() function takes an array of data as input and returns an array of React elements. Each element in the output array is created by calling a callback function that is passed to the map() function.
The callback function takes an item from the input array as input and returns a React element. The callback function should also assign a unique key to the React element.
The <li> tag in HTML defines a list item.
